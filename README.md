# React Todo MVC example

This example demonstrates how you can use Fireproof to build a collaborative version of the [Todo MVC](http://todomvc.com) app.

# To start the application clone this repo and follow the steps:

1)Change directory to todo-react

2) Do an npm install

3) npm start

4) cd server and write npx partykit dev

5) Now you are good to go. Try using two different browser instances for the application and see how it reacts to changes and adopts to a multiplayer environment. Feel free to experiment with the code and change the name of the database to something else inside App,TodoList and TodoItem's useFireproof hooks  to start with a fresh one
